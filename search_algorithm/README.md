Binary Search algorithm is an algorithm that finds the position of a target in a sorted array. Binary Search compares the target value ti the middle element of the array. If they are equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search contnues on the remaing half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array. Even though the idea is simple, implimenting binary search correctly requires attention to some substleties about its exit conditoins and midpoint calculation, particularly if the values in the array are not all of the whole numbers in the range.
